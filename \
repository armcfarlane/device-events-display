# device-events-display

This service displays events for a device.  The events are specified by the device's mac address as well as the time interval.

## Create Development Environment

To execute a local copy of the code that runs locally on host:
```sh
./mgr dev
```

This is useful when you're first developing the application.  A python  virtual environment is created if it doesn't exist.
When you edit a python file, uvicorn is restarted with your newly edited application.

This development strategy is faster than deploying the application inside a locally-running container, checking out if the
changes worked, re-building, re-deploying, etc.
